# Supermarket Management System

This repository contains the **complete technical and user documentation** of a
Full Stack supermarket management system developed following **Software Engineering principles**.

---

## Project Overview
The system manages supermarket products and includes an **optimization algorithm**
that computes the best shelf distribution based on product relationships.

---

## Optimization Algorithm
The algorithm:
- Analyzes the relationship degree between products
- Computes optimal shelf placement
- Improves product grouping and accessibility

---

## Documentation
This project includes **extensive documentation**, covering system design and implementation:

- **Technical documentation (HTML):** `documentation/html/`
- **User manual:** `manual_usuari.pdf`
- **Test cases:** `test_cases/`

---

## How to View the Documentation
1. Open the folder `documentation/html/`
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
3. Navigate through the documentation using the menu

---

## Notes
This project was developed as part of my studies in **Software Engineering** at UPC,
with a strong focus on system design, documentation and architectural decisions.
